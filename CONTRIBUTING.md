How Can I Contribute?
---------------------

### Reporting a Bug
If you have stumbled across a crash, error or bug you can send us an [issue on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). 
In your issue, please describe the steps to reproduce the unexpected behaviour.

## Suggesting a Feature
If you have a brilliant idea you are very welcome to share it with us via an [issue on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
In your issue, please describe the proposed changes and/or additions.

## Code Contributions
If you have experience with C# and Git and are willing to contribute code to our cause, you can 
[fork the project on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and start making changes or bugfixes. In the fork you can
create a branch for the patch you want to work on.

Pull Requests *should*:

- focus on resolving a single issue on the issue tracker -or- add a single feature/bugfix
- not consist of commits with bad descriptions
- not consist of useless commits
- consist of a minimal number of commits. If your Pull Request contains more commits than you'd like, check out the [Git rebase User Documentation on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/)
- comply with the [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) which can be found within this project
